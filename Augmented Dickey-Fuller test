Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to see if my data is or is not stationary.
I did this because I am having issues with the ARIMA model and one way 
to determine weather or not ARIMA is the correct option is to write a ADF test.
A lot of my scores have a p-value of below 0.05, suggesting evidence against a
null hypothesis but that does not seem right to me. EEG signals are typically non-stationary
due to the complex cortical activity in different regions of the brain.
Something is wrong and I am having issues coming to a conclusion.
